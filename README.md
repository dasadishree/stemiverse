# stemiverse
Made a website for @stemiverse_ on Instagram, a STEM nonprofit founded by my sister and others from my high school as a Techfluences website. Theme was tacky, millenial space, particularly purple, similar to their Instagram theme. Note: AI assistance to debug the side scrolling effect and make it mobile friendly.
